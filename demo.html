                    <p>
                        Bosvark Consulting Group (BVC) takes great pride in the shared commitment and collaboration with
                        SABRE Training & Advisory Group, an organization that emerged from a genuine concern for the
                        quality of training provided to Ukrainian soldiers. BVC's founder is also a board member and
                        director at SABRE. SABRE is driven by a mission to address the deficiencies observed in foreign
                        instructors attempting to train Ukrainian forces in NATO and Allied-style warfare.
                    </p>

                    <p><strong>Key Highlights of SABRE Training & Advisory Group:</strong></p>

                        <li>
                            <strong>Origin and Founding Motivation:</strong> SABRE's inception was rooted in the
                            frustrations experienced by its founding members concerning the chaotic and unprofessional
                            nature of foreign
                            instructors attempting to train Ukrainian soldiers. Recognizing the need for a more
                            effective and
                            structured approach, SABRE was established to bring a higher standard of training to the
                            forefront.

                        <li>
                            <strong>Experienced Team with Military Background:</strong> The SABRE team boasts over 30

                            programs. This depth of experience ensures that Ukrainian defenders receive top-notch
                            instruction
                            aligned with international standards.

                            <strong>Operational Flexibility and Frontline Presence:</strong> SABRE distinguishes itself
                            by its commitment
                            to operating wherever required, with a significant portion of its operations taking place at
                            the frontlines. This operational flexibility enables SABRE to directly engage with Ukrainian

                            committed instructors, the SABRE team has been actively supporting Ukrainian soldiers for
                            the past 18 months. Their
                            dedication contributes to the effectiveness of training programs, fostering the development

                            Volya, SABRE has
                            successfully delivered over $150,000 worth of tactical medical equipment to assist soldiers
                            on the frontlines. This collaborative humanitarian effort reflects the commitment of SABRE
                            to
                            not only provide training but also contribute to the well-being of those actively serving in
                            challenging conditions.

                            <strong>Shared Profits to Support SABRE and Project Volya:</strong> A notable aspect of
                            BVC's mission is the allocation of a portion of all profits to support the efforts of SABRE
                            and Project Volya.
                            This commitment underscores the holistic approach taken by BVC, recognizing the importance
                            of
                            contributing to both training initiatives and humanitarian projects.
